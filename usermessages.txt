[QUOTE=vals26]Hi,

I would like to start saying that I really love your work here on ModTheSims.
My name is Valentina and I'm writing an essay for my University about The Sims modding as a way for women to approach and learn IT.
As I don't know your gender, I would like to ask you to answer few questions only if you're a woman and, of course, if you decide to take part.
It will be some sort of interview and it should only take 5 minutes. I would only cite you in my essay with your ModTheSims username.
The questions are:
1) At what age have you started to create mods for The Sims?
2) Did you have any previous IT skills, including programming and/or 3D modelling?
3) Do you think that creating mods for The Sims has helped you feeling more interested into IT?

I really hope you can answer my questions, it would help me a lot!  

Thank you so much for your time

Hi, yes I am a woman. I started nodding sims at 20 years old and I am 32 now. I had zero experience in all those things. I self taught myself how to mod and asked questions at nraas when I got stuck. I am definitely more interested in IT now than before, especially programming. I want to learn python so I can better mod sims 4.

Thanks for including me!

Hello Valentina! :)
Thank you for sending your message to me!

I sure will answer the questions for you:

1. Well, I only just turned 14 a couple weeks ago (I am a female), and I started modding in the summer (2018) so I could say I started modding at age 13.
2. If you didn't already know, I am nearly a pro animator (since in the future I have to be professional if I want to work with a company), I can do 3D modelling, but at the moment I'm quite standard, I have modeled a couple characters though. I'm in the processing of learning coding too.
3. Yes, definitely. Ever since I started modding for The Sims, I've wanted to learn how to code and in general just learn the basics of programming. And thanks to The Sims, I can animate, as well as have a big desire to work in The Sims Studio, where they developed most Sims games.

There you go, I hope this was helpful for your project  :bunny:

Hello, I am a woman, so I will respond to your questions.

1) At what age have you started to create mods for The Sims?
I'm 30 years old and recently I started to create mods.

2) Did you have any previous IT skills, including programming and/or 3D modelling?
No, never. I am an autodidact person and I learn everything from scratch.

3) Do you think that creating mods for The Sims has helped you feeling more interested into IT?

I always had an interest on learning IT and by modding I started to learn more at least at this level, but of course, by learning I got more interest on it, even I was thinking on learning in depth.

Valentina[/QUOTE]

Yes I'm a woman (but not young) and I'm happy to participate! I like for people to be aware that there are women in the technical/programming side of modding. 

1. I started to mod for The Sims at about age 58, and I'm 67 now. 
2. Yes, I was working as a applications programmer/analyst and IT manager, using primarily Cold Fusion, JavaScript, a little Java, and before that Fortran.
3. To work on Sims modding I learned IL for making TS3 core mods, an enhanced version of Fortran (briefly), but mostly I've learned C# and Visual Studio. C# is the first OOP language I learned in depth so it was a challenge at first but very worth it. I've also learned a lot about working with images. 
4. I've always loved IT and programming. Modding has enabled me to carry that interest into retirement and write tools that are useful to people, analyze data structures, etc. 
5. As mentioned above, I used to work in IT. Also I have a Masters in IT Methodology.  

Don't know if it's relevant but I'm very happy to be involved in the Sims community, not least for the opportunity to keep my mind active and keep learning new things.

Thanks!  I am a woman, so I'll answer your questions.  Although, as a heads up, when we say "IT" we usually mean "tech support" and not "programming".

[quote]1) At what age have you started to create mods for The Sims and how old are you now?[/quote]

I was 25 when I started (in 2009) and I'm 34 now.

[quote]2) Did you have any previous IT skills, including programming languanges and/or 3D modelling?[/quote]

I was fairly competent at C++, but didn't really know any other languages well at that point.  I was also basically entirely self-taught, I never really took any classes to learn C++.  However, at some point in that time period I switched my major to CS and began taking classes mostly focused on Java, which is, however, a language I never used much in my personal or professional projects.

[quote]3) Which skills have you learned to create mods for The Sims?[/quote]

Mainly skills related to how SimAntics in particular works, and the kinds of things you can do with it.  It's hard to translate a lot of those skills into other sorts of programming, but understanding some low-level things like how numbers are represented by computers is useful, and I think some knowledge of assembly language is useful, since SimAntics is sort of like a Sims assembly language.  I think I had already created my first mod by the time I learned these things properly in college, so I came a little prepared with knowledge of what things like "opcode" and "operand" meant, and other things I learned helped me improve my mods.

[quote]4) Do you think that creating mods for The Sims has helped you being more interested to IT?[/quote]

Well, I was already pretty interested by that point.  I guess it made me a bit more interested in lower-level languages, though.

[quote]5) Do you work or study in an IT field?[/quote]

I currently work as a software developer, and I have a master's degree in computational linguistics, which I got during my long absence from Sims fandom in the 2010's.

[quote]Feel also free to add any comments about your modding experience related to The Sims that you think it might be relevant to the topic![/quote]

I actually thought for a long time that I couldn't do Sims 2 modding, because all the intro tutorials were about recoloring and meshing and so forth, so I thought you had to be able to create textures or meshes in order to mod.  It was only after I found the "advanced" tutorials about how functions worked that I realized I could make mods, and what kinds of things I could do.  I don't know if things have changed now and those tutorials aren't classified as "advanced" anymore, but IMO they shouldn't be.

Good luck with your assignment!

Valentina[/QUOTE]

Hello there! I'd be happy to help.

1) At what age have you started to create mods for The Sims and how old are you now?

I started September last year, when I was 27. I just had my birthday (12/13) so now I'm 29.

2) Did you have any previous IT skills, including programming languages and/or 3D modelling?

I had absolutely no experience in 3D modelling, and no real programming experience. Nor do I now. However, I am self-taught in HTML, CSS, and some Javascript. I've been slowly – very slowly – picking up Python.

3) Which skills have you learned to create mods for The Sims?

Through looking up tutorials, I learned about DirectDraw files (.dds) to manipulate the look of items in the game. I also found my way around some of the "home-grown" programs here such as Sims 3 Package Editor, Sims 3 Object Cloner, Texture Tweaker 3, and The Sims Resource Workshop. I was also reacquainted with Adobe Photoshop and my first love, an image program called The GIMP.  :) 

4) Do you think that creating mods for The Sims has helped you become more interested in IT?

Yes, although I've always been interested in the field. Modding for The Sims has made me want to learn more coding languages (primarily C++ which the game uses) in order to provide more mods for the community. As of now, I'm not at that level yet, but I hope to be sometime in the future!

5) Do you work or study in an IT field?

Nope. I work in education and freelance in editorial and communications. My degree is in English.


If you have any other questions (or questions about my answers!) please feel free to follow up.

Cheers.

Hi Valentina,

I don't really consider myself a modder.  I use a really basic tool to make these career... it's more creative writing than anything.  I'm happy to participate if you'd like me to, but I want to be upfront about that. :)

Asia[/QUOTE]

Hi Asia,
Thanks for your answer.

I'm looking at different points of view and stories, so I would love to hear from you too, even though you don't consider yourself a modder!  :D 

Thanks again

Valentina[/QUOTE]

In that case sure.  What do I need to do?[/QUOTE]

If you could please answer the following questions, it would be fab!
1) At what age have you started to create mods for The Sims and how old are you now?
2) Did you have any previous IT skills, including programming languanges and/or 3D modelling?
3) Which skills have you learned to create mods for The Sims?
4) Do you think that creating mods for The Sims has helped you being more interested to IT?
5) Do you work or study in an IT field?

Thanks again

Valentina[/QUOTE]

Sure. Here you go.  And Thanks for the kind words.  I hope this helps. 

1) At what age have you started to create mods for The Sims and how old are you now?
I made my first custom content items for Sims 1.  Mainly because I couldn't find anything for the plus sized Simmies.  I believe so that I was around 30ish?  I'm 48 now.

2) Did you have any previous IT skills, including programming languages and/or 3D modelling?
I have some RELLY light 3D modeling skills.  I used Blender to make poses for Sims 3.

3) Which skills have you learned to create mods for The Sims?
Well, I don't really consider myself a modder.  But I did enjoy using Blender once I got the hang of it.  As far as IT skills go, I mostly just consider myself software savvy.  I would love to code, but fidning the time to really learn the skills is the real challenge.

4) Do you think that creating mods for The Sims has helped you being more interested to IT?
I think so.  Some one the programs I used I would never have given a second look if not for the Sims. 

5) Do you work or study in an IT field?
I'm in software sales, which requires me to keep abreast of changing technology and digital platforms.

Hi Valentina,

Yes, I am a woman. I started creating at age 20. I grew up in a household with lots of computers and coding. My father used to code video games for Disney back in the 70s. My first word was 'Apple', because that's what was on the computers that Dad had in our basement when I was a toddler (late 80s). I took Computers in 4H and created my own educational video game about genetics. In high school I'd taken the 3D modeling classes. I'd always been creative and innovative and went to college for industrial design. There I learned product design and game theory. The foundation classes taught Photoshop and different modeling programs. In the months in between when I'd decided to switch majors (I started in Architecture), I kept myself busy and ahead of my peers (highly competitive college curriculum) by delving into creating and modding for sims. Creating for sims has given me a steady flow of projects to keep my interests up and skills sharp. I've included my MTS profile on my resume almost since day one. In Industrial Design, contests and projects and portfolio work are more important than grades, so sims always gave me something interest and unique to talk about at my interviews. I wouldn't say that sims has helped me become more interested in IT, but it has been my life raft while I get to where I want to be with my career.

Thanks for reaching out!

Hi Valentina,
I thank you and I must say that I found myself quite surprised by your message, but I agree to help you for your project as I am a woman of 21 yo.  No problem ~
Being also a student, I sympathize with you! (and even more when it comes to The Sims haha!).

So here are my answers:

1 - At what age have you started to create mods for The Sims?
 -> I only started 5 months ago, however I was already looking at the structure of the mods and the packaging of the game for several years (5, 6 years I guess).

2 - Did you have any previous IT skills, including programming and / or 3D modeling?
-> No knowledge in 3D // However I love to modify or create websites internets (with CCS, javascript code ...), I learned alone to develop my skills (so sad says like that!).

3 - Do you think that creating mods for The Sims has helped you feeling more interested into IT?
-> My vision to change, in fact before I created mods, I started by working these two passions each on their own side to really explore several things and not necessarily just to develop only my IT skills for the game The Sims.
But, now that I create mods, it's true that I try to improve myself on some points in IT (especially for python files, my actual big problem ) for creation of my future mods. Even if sometimes I'm fed up and it gets complicated, the next day or later I will continue to document IT because I really want to understand it and use it!


I hope that my answers can help for your project, and that you understand my approximate English!
If you have other questions or you need more informations don't hesitate to ask me ^^

Good luck with all this!

Have a good day :)
